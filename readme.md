To ensure this code runs successfully, you need to install the following dependencies. Here's a list of required Python packages along with installation commands:

---

### **1. Core Dependencies**
#### **Required Libraries**
| Library            | Purpose                                         | Installation Command                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **`telebot`**      | Telegram Bot API integration.                   | `pip install pyTelegramBotAPI`          |
| **`requests`**     | For HTTP requests (e.g., Hugging Face API).     | `pip install requests`                  |
| **`Pillow`**       | For handling image files.                       | `pip install Pillow`                    |
| **`transformers`** | For Hugging Face models (VQA and others).       | `pip install transformers`              |
| **`google-generativeai`** | For Google Gemini API interaction.         | `pip install google-generativeai`       |

---

### **2. Hugging Face Transformers**
The `transformers` library will automatically download pre-trained models, but you must also have **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** installed. 

- Install **PyTorch** (preferred for most Hugging Face models):
  - Use [PyTorch's official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to find the appropriate command for your environment.
  - Common installation:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
    ```

---

### **3. Base64 (Standard Library)**
The `base64` module is part of Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required.

---

### **4. Additional Notes**
- If you encounter issues with any of the libraries, ensure you're using a supported version of Python (Python 3.7 or higher is recommended).
- To avoid version conflicts, consider creating a **virtual environment** and installing the dependencies inside it:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  
  venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
  ```

---

### **Installing All at Once**
You can install all the dependencies at once using the following:
```bash
pip install pyTelegramBotAPI requests Pillow transformers google-generativeai torch torchvision torchaudio
```

For specific API or model issues, check the corresponding library documentation.

pip install telebot pytesseract fitz transformers pillow
pip install torch torchvision pymupdf openai==0.28 pyTelegramBotAPI requests python-dotenv sentence-transformers faiss-cpu

1. **Hugging Face Transformers Library**: 
   - Models like `Salesforce/blip-vqa-base` (for VQA) and `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` (for text-based QA) are downloaded directly from the Hugging Face model hub without the need for an API key. 
   - These models are loaded locally onto your system when you run the code for the first time.

2. **API-Free Implementation**: 
   - The models and processors are instantiated directly via `from_pretrained`, which downloads and caches them locally.

### Why Avoid Using API Keys?
- Using API keys is typically required for **hosted inference APIs** or enterprise features on Hugging Face (e.g., when you make remote HTTP requests to Hugging Face Inference endpoints).
- Local execution with the `transformers` library is independent of these hosted services, offering flexibility and avoiding API usage limits.

### Summary
This implementation only needs access to the pre-trained models and your local system resources, meaning no Hugging Face API key is necessary. Ensure you have internet access when running the code initially so the models can download successfully.
